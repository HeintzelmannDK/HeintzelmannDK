- I am a lifelong nerd with all things technical. I am from the golden generation that transitioned from analog to digital. I was a nerd before Google was invented.
- I excel in electrical engineering, PLC programming, PID regulation, tinkering with stuff, stealing (for inspiration) code and creating useful stuff.
- Through years of professional work, I am also an expert in product development, product management, business development, and especially linking R&D work with the commercial part of the business.
- Besides the IT related nerdery, I am also a skilled craftsman and often invent and build machines for all sorts of things. I work in wood, steel, 3D printing, laser cutting and engraving, and much more.
- I also play a bit of music, drive and maintain my Land Rovers, and generally try to be a nice guy.
- I am no expert in anything, but I can do almost anything.
